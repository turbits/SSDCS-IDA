# Team Transparency - IDA

## What is IDA?

IDA, or ISS Data Archive, is a secure repository software that offers secure storage and access to information. Encrypted information is processed, decrypted on-premises, and stored in a secure local database. Authenticated users can access and optionally manipulate the data via a locally hosted web interface.

## What is Team Transparency?

Team Transparency is a group of students in the _University of Essex Online - Secure Software Development (PCOM7E January 2023)_ course.

## What is the purpose of this repository?

This repository is used to store the code for the IDA project. For a full list of project technologies used, see the [Dependencies](#dependencies) section.

## How to set up the project

For MacOS: Python 2.7 might be installed by default, make sure you're running Python 3.11+ (python --version) in terminal

For Windows: use Powershell or Git Bash to run commands (not CMD)

- Ensure [prerequisites](#prerequisites) are done
- See [Run The Project](#run-the-project)
- For issues running the project see [Issues](#issues)

## Prerequisites

- Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), version 3.11.2 or higher, ensure it is added to your PATH (MacOS might have issues with this, might need to do some research)
- You should be linting your project with flake8 in your IDE
  - You can ignore E501 (line too long), or if using vscode: suppress it in vscode by adding this to settings: `"flake8.args": ["--ignore=E501"],`
- Restart your terminal (so PATH changes take effect)
- Git clone this repository and navigate to the project root
- Install virtualenv: `pip install virtualenv==20.19.0`
- Install pipenv: `pip install pipenv==2023.2.18`

## Run the project

- Run the following to enter the virtual env (run this in the project root): `pipenv shell`
- Install all required packages from the Pipfile (run this in the project root): `pipenv install`
- Add the `.env` file provided to you to the root of the project (depending on OS you might need to enable hidden files to see/make this)
- TODO: automate database seeding
- Run `python ida.py`
- Access the web interface at `http://localhost:8080/`

- make sure you're using Powershell or Git Bash on Windows
- make sure you're using Python 3.11 or higher

**ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'bottle'**:

- make sure you're running the project in the virtual environment - run `pipenv shell` in the root of the project
